## **Agenda**

1. Updates 
2. Make Final Tables and Plots, and Final Determinations of Possibly Accreted Clusters
3. Finding Academic Papers to Support Our Arguments
4. Start Making Slides for Our Presentation
5. Decide Who Will Talk About Each Topic

## **Updates**

| **Person** | **Updates** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Billy |- Found a few bugs in the plots I've made in my brainstorming file where my code won't classify the GC's that don't have an age error value so I just need to fix that up and then record my part of the video|
| Brandon |- Still looking for possible bimodal relationships that might help better determine accretion <br>- Currently on holiday in Japan for flex-week so it's gonna be a bit more difficult to get work done but I'm going to set aside some dedicated hours to collaborate and record  my section of the video|
| Saxon |- Started reading some academic papers to see what kind of determination criteria is used and what plots could be more useful in our persuit <br>- Looking at how I can use plot point labelling to distinguish between certain GC's to make determination easier if a cluster is present in a crowded spot of a plot <br>- I also want to look at what variables would be the most useful to plot with colourbars, I was thinking age or rotational velocity for some of the plots but I'll have to go by trial and error|

## **Minutes / Action Items**

| **Issue** | **Action Items** |
| :--- | :--- | 
| Lack of Useful Dynamical Variables | There are some dynamical variables such as direction of rotation around the Milky Way or spin direction that might make determination easier. I have been made aware of a python package called 'galpy' which has a catalogue of known GC's and some unique dynamical data that I could use to plot with. |
| Feeling Behind | Though we've made plenty of plots and have identified around 20 possibly accreted GC's, we still feel like there is more to do for this assingment, we're just not quite sure what but we can set a goal to find around 30 which will be satisfactory to us. I think I read somewhere that around 40-50 of the clusters in the Harris data were determined to be accreted so 30 seems like a decent target. |
| Brandon Holiday | Currently Brandon is on holiday in Japan (lucky) but this means that it will make collaboration a little bit harder as we now have to navigate between our own availabilities and when Brandon is not exploring Japan. I'm sure we can manage but its just a little hitch. |
| Issues with Merging all Tables | I found that while merging tables, two different columns we're made for age and metallicity between Krause and vandenBerg, this is because the ages and metallicities of the common GC's are slightly different. I've been thinking of a way to remedy this by maybe averaging them but I don't like this idea so I'll just make two merged files, one for Krause and Harris and one for vandenBerg and Harris. |
