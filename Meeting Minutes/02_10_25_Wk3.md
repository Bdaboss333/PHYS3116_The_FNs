## **Attendees**

Billy, Brandon, Saxon

## **Apologees**

No-one

## **Agenda**

1. Updates 
2. Figuring out what we actually have to do for the assignment
3. Make brainstorming files for each group member

## **Updates**

| **Person** | **Updates** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Billy |- Plotted the location of galaxies in 3d<br>- Doesn't help us at all but looks cool|
| Brandon |- Fixed vscode wowzers it works now<br>- Made a plot cool<br>- Comfortable with Python/VSCode now nice|
| Saxon |- Fixed like 30 peoples vscode (Unappointed vscode technician, I'm the goat tbh)<br>- Also made some cool plots with colours and labels and whatnot<br> |

## **Minutes / Action Items**

| **Issue** | **Action Items** |
| :--- | :--- | 
| What do we actually need to do | - Figure out how to distingush accreted globular clusters from non-accreted and in-situ<br>- Find papers to help with this lol no we have not done this since last week<br>- Basically we just need to research and learn<br>- Nvm found a paper it's 'In-situ vs. Accreted Milky Way globular clusters: a new classification method blah blah blah<br> - Look at location of accreted and in situ within milky way to find relationship<br|
| File Organisation | - Making individual files for each person to use for brainstorming and trying new ideas<br>- Basically vscode branches but saves us from having to deal with more vscode problems |
| What is accreted vs. in-situ | - Accreted globular cluster is gc that didn't form in milky way and ended up here via galaxy merge or smth I think<br> - In-situ means the gc was formed in the milky way |
| Finding Bimodal relationship |- Try plot defining variable (metallicity or age) against a non-defining variable (size, mass)|
| Plotting Dynamical Data | - Figure out what dynamical plots we should make and what accreted globular clusters actually look like in data (are accreted clusters mega outliers in terms of mass or velocity, or do they spin in the wrong direction sometimes? stuff like that.)|

This was relatively short meeting will probs have another one tmrw we'll see. (Decided just to have the same meeting again today but with me (Saxon) in it this time (my bad I was at work), Billy and Brandon just got me up to speed and I presented my contributions and ideas).
