| :--- | :--- | 
| What do we actually need to do | - Figure out how to distingush accreted globular clusters from non-accreted and in-situ<br>- Find papers to help with this lol no we have not done this since last week<br>- Basically we just need to research and learn<br>- Nvm found a paper it's 'In-situ vs. Accreted Milky Way globular clusters: a new classification method blah blah blah |
| File Organisation | - Making individual files for each person to use for brainstorming and trying new ideas<br>- Basically vscode branches but saves us from having to deal with more vscode problems |
| What is accreted vs. in-situ | - Accreted globular cluster is gc that didn't form in milky way and ended up here via galaxy merge or smth I think<br> - In-situ means the gc was formed in the milky way |

This was relatively short meeting will probs have another one tmrw we'll see
